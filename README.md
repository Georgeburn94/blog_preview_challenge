## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this session, I got a solid refresher on Flexbox and how it makes creating responsive layouts way easierâ€”just by aligning and spacing items within a container. I also picked up a handy tip: using padding around images can be simpler and more reliable than messing with margins, especially when you want to avoid spacing issues. Plus, I learned how to switch up cursor states, like turning the cursor into a pointer when hovering over buttons or links, which is a small but cool way to make a site feel more interactive. Overall, these tricks are making my designs cleaner and more user-friendly!

I also worked with a Figma design file for the first time, translating it into code, which gave me a more realistic workflow and helped me understand how to bridge the gap between design and development.


### Useful resources
